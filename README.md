# Revit2glTF - A Revit glTF Exporter
This is currently a work in progress but the end goal is to create an open source implementation of an extensible exporter from Autodesk Revit to the glTF model format.

## Current To-Do's
- Handle material export
- Handle normals export
- Add option to export colors only, or full Autodesk materials.
- Add toggle for exporting each element as a seperate .bin vs a single .glb.
- Add element properties to extension on glTF nodes.
- Add element properties to a sqlite file referenced by glTF nodes.
